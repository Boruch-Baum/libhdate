* Installation from source

  This package is available for most major operating systems, so in
  most cases if you just want to use the command line programs, the
  following instructions are unnecessary; just install your
  distribution's pre-built package, or a packaged binary from a
  reliable repository compatable with your distribution.

* Pre-Requisites

+ GNU toolchain, ie. gcc, libtoolize, autoreconf, and make. Your
  distribution may package these as `build-essential`, `libtool`,
  `autoconf`, and `automake`.

* Procedure

+ Run the provided shell script `autogen.sh`.

  The script will invoke `libtoolize`, `autoreconf`, `configure`, and
  `make`. Upon success, you can either use the built files at their
  current paths, or you can perform `sudo make install` to install
  them system-wide on your machine.

* Extra credit

+ The extensive manuals and documentation for the elements of the GNU
  toolchain are a reliable source of interminable travail,
  frustration, torture, and enlightenment for all those who would dare
  turn to them. The search engine of your choice also works.
