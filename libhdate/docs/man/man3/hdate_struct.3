int \fBhd_jd\fP
The Julian Day Number. Do not confuse this with a Julian calendar (technically, the "julian proleptic calendar") value. The Julian Day Number system is a convenience introduced by astronomers for scientific use, to provide a single system of dates that could be used when working with different calendars, and to unify different historical chronologies. Julian day number (JDN) zero corresponds to January 1, 4713 BCE Greenwich noon, according to the "julian proleptic calendar" (ie NOT according to the Gregorian calendar).

\fBlibhdate\fP is a small C/C++ library for Hebrew dates, holidays, and reading
sequences (parashiot). It uses the source code from Amos Shapir's "hdate" package, as fixed and patched by Nadav Har'El. The Torah
reading sequence tables were contributed by Zvi Har'El.
