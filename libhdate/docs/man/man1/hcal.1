.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B hcal
prints a calendar with both Gregorian and Hebrew dates for the
specified Gregorian month or, if no month is specified, for the
whole Gregorian year. If no arguments are given, it prints the
current month's calendar. Jewish holidays are annotated, and can
optionally be footnoted.
.B hcal
tries to be sunset-aware in order to correctly highlight the
current Hebrew date, and can also display Shabbat times and
parshiot. See the section LOCATION, below.
.PP
.B INPUTTING A HEBREW DATE:
If the year provided is greater than 3000,
.B hcal
will interpret the given date as a Hebrew date, and will display the calendar of the corresponding Gregorian month(s). Hebrew months are expected to be passed as numbers 1-12 for Tishrei - Elul; Adar I and Adar II are expected to be passed as months 13 and 14.

.SS LOCATIONS 
If you want 
.B hcal
to display accurate Shabbat times, and to accurately advance the Hebrew 'today's date' indicator at sunset, 
.B hcal
requires location and time zone information in order to make astronomical calculations for a given date. If you don't provide ANY such information, 
.B hcal
uses your computer's local time zone information as an indicator, and either picks a city in that time zone, or defaults to the equator at the center of that time zone. If 
.B hcal
can't even retrieve time zone information from your computer, it defaults to Tel-Aviv. For other locations, use the 
.B -l -L
option pair. For other timezones, use the 
.B -z
option. Co-ordinates and standard time zones for some common locations are listed below.

.B Historical
The software does not yet account for the phenomenon and complications of the "Gregorian transition" from the prior, Julian calendar, which effectively caused an instantaneous 'loss' of two weeks for all gentiles affected. Countries (eg. Poland, Spain and Italy) began adopting the Gregorian calendar on 8 Tishrei 5343 (4 October 1582CE), although many did not transition until the 56th century (1752 CE, eg. UK colonies, Sweden). Russia did not adopt the Gregorian calendar until 5678 (1918 CE) and Turkey did not until 5687 (December, 1926 CE). Many other countries made the transition on other dates. Keep in mind that Russia invaded part of Poland, undoing, for the interim, the Gregorian transition for (only) that part of Poland; Also important to remember in this regard is that Eretz Ysroel was part of the Turkish Ottoman empire until the British mandate (5677 (1917CE)). Until all this is accounted for adequately by this application, refer to '
.B ncal -p
\' for a basic table of country transitions. However, keep in mind that European borders underwent many changes during the 426 years in question, so the accuracy of your data will depend on accurate knowledge of whether any particular date at any specific location was Julian or Gregorian.

.B Hcal
and
.B Hdate
are part of the package
.B libhdate
, a small C/C++ library for Hebrew dates, holidays, and reading
sequences (parashiot). It uses the source code from Amos Shapir's
"hdate" package, as fixed and patched by Nadav Har'El. The Torah
reading sequence tables were contributed by Zvi Har'El.
