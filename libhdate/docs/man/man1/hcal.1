.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBhcal\fP prints a calendar with both Gregorian and Hebrew dates for the specified Gregorian month or, if no month is specified, for the whole Gregorian year. If no arguments are given, it prints the current month's calendar. Jewish holidays are annotated, and can
optionally be footnoted. \fBhcal\fP tries to be sunset-aware in order to correctly highlight the current Hebrew date, and can also display Shabbat times and parshiot. See the section \fBLOCATIONS\fP, below.
.PP
.B INPUTTING A HEBREW DATE:
If the year provided is greater than 3000, \fBhcal\fP will interpret the given date as a Hebrew date, and will display the calendar of the corresponding Gregorian month(s). Hebrew months are expected to be passed as numbers 1-12 for Tishrei - Elul; Adar I and Adar II are expected to be passed as months 13 and 14.

.SS LOCATIONS 
If you want \fBhcal\fP to display accurate time-of-day information,\fBhcal\fP requires location and time zone information in order to make astronomical calculations for a given date. If you don't provide ANY such information, \fBhcal\fP tries to find out your computer's local time zone information as an indicator, and picks the 'primary' city in that time zone. If \fBhcal\fP can't find local time zone information, \fBhcal\fP tries to find out your computer's GMT offset, and either picks from the list below the city in that time zone offset, or defaults to the equator at the center of that time zone offset. If \fBhcal\fP can't even retrieve GMT offset information from your computer, it defaults to Tel-Aviv. For other locations, use the \fB-l -L\fP option pair. For other timezones, use the \fB-z\fP option. Co-ordinates and standard time zones for some common locations are listed below.

.B Historical
The software does not yet account for the phenomenon and complications of the "Gregorian transition" from the prior, Julian calendar, which effectively caused an instantaneous 'loss' of two weeks for all gentiles affected. Countries (eg. Poland, Spain and Italy) began adopting the Gregorian calendar on 8 Tishrei 5343 (4 October 1582 CE), although many did not transition until the 56th century (1752 CE, eg. UK colonies, Sweden). Russia did not adopt the Gregorian calendar until 5678 (1918 CE) and Turkey did not until 5687 (December, 1926 CE). Many other countries made the transition on other dates. Keep in mind that Russia invaded part of Poland, undoing, for the interim, the Gregorian transition for (only) that part of Poland; Also important to remember in this regard is that Eretz Ysroel was part of the Turkish Ottoman empire until the British mandate (5677 (1917 CE)). Until all this is accounted for adequately by this application, refer to '\fBncal -p\fP' for a basic table of country transitions. However, keep in mind that European borders underwent many changes during the 426 years in question, so the accuracy of your data will depend on accurate knowledge of whether any particular date at any specific location was Julian or Gregorian.

\fBhcal\fP and \fBhdate\fP are part of the package \fBlibhdate\fP, a small C/C++ library for Hebrew dates, holidays, and reading
sequences (parashiot). It uses the source code from Amos Shapir's "hdate" package, as fixed and patched by Nadav Har'El. The Torah
reading sequence tables were contributed by Zvi Har'El.
