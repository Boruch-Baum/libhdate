Libhdate, hcal, hdate

LibHdate is a small library for the Hebrew calendar, dates, holidays,
and reading sequence. It is written in C and includes bindings for
pascal, perl, python, php, ruby.

hcal and hdate are small example command line programs written in C.

The function library is based upon Amos Shapir's "hdate" package,
as fixed and patched by Nadav Har'El. See below for that original
package's README. The Torah reading sequence is based upon tables
written by Zvi Har'El.

see USE file for a basic example of how to use one of the library
functions in a C program, how to compile it, and how to run it.

see the man pages and examples directory for further documentation
and examples.
