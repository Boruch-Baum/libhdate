Libhdate, hcal, hdate: version 1..6 released
============================================

LibHdate is a small library for the Hebrew calendar, dates, holidays,
and reading sequence. It is written in C and includes bindings for
pascal, perl, python, php, ruby.

hcal and hdate are small example command line programs, written in C.

This release brings many new options, features, and bug fixes to the two example
programs hcal and hdate. The changes to the underlying function library include
a few minor bug fixes, deprecation of a series of string functions in favor
of a single new one with better memory allocation, and hard-coding of core
elements of the Hebrew localization so that Hebrew can be displayed in all
locales. The documentation in the man pages and in the new configuration
file should be sufficient. See the Changelog for more information than most of
you probably want to know about the changes . . . :
