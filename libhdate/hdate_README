hdate_README: This is the original README file from hdate 0.5p (see README file
for this project readme).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is Amos Shapir's "hdate" package fixed and patched by Nadav Har'El.
Below is the original package's README - see NEWS for what changed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the 5th distribution of hdate/hcal.  It should be portable
anywhere, but for machines which have sizeof(int) != sizeof(long), you
may have to change a few 'int's to 'long', and suffix 'L' to some
constants; sorry, I have no way to tell which.  It also expects the UNIX
"time.h" structures, but that shouldn't be hard to change to fit other
systems.  If you port the code to any other system, please send the
diffs to the author for inclusion in the next release.

The files included  herein are:
README - this file.
explain - an explanation of the algorithm.
hdate.6 - the man page (nroff/troff source).
Makefile
hdate.h - common definitions.
hdate.c - main source file for hdate.
hcal.c - main source file for hcal.
hcom.c - code common to both hdate & hcal.

Compilation options:

HEBREW - make a version that prints on a Hebrew printer/terminal, given
the "-h" flag.  All Hebrew words are initialized in left-to-right
lower-case letters, and passed through the function rev() for
conversion.  I have included a function which reverses them to
right-to-left order, and optionally converts to the ISO-8859/8 standard
or IBM representation.  You may need to write your own rev() function to
convert to what your printer expects, or else delete it and pipe the
output through "rev", "tr" or "sed".

USA_DATE - make hdate accept the arguments as "month day year" instead
of the default "day month year" (note that hdate.6 has to be changed to
document this order).

	Good Luck,
