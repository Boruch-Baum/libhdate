Compiling
=========

The ctypes.pp unit was taken from FPC 1.9.8 version and was modified to contain also some floating point C equivalent. 
I hope that version 2.0 will contains them as well, if not please keep this unit, otherwise feel free to remove it.

Add the hdate.pp and the hdate_obj.pp (or thier .ppu files after compilation) to the path of fpc.cfg in order to use 
the units globally with all of your applications.
